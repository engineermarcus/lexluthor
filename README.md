## 🚀 DEPLOY ON RENDER (RECOMMENDED - STABLE)

### Prerequisites
1. Get your session ID from [here](https://lexluthermd.onrender.com)
2. Fork this repository

### Deploy Steps

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) and create a new **Web Service**
2. Connect your forked GitHub repository
3. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` and `Dockerfile`
4. Set these environment variables:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `SESSION_ID` | Your session ID from session manager |
| `OWNER_NUMBER` | Your WhatsApp number (without +) |
| `COOKIE_CONTENT` | *(Optional)* Your Instagram cookies for `.ig` command |

5. Click **Deploy**

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Keep it Alive 24/7

Render's free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity. **You MUST set up UptimeRobot** to keep your bot running 24/7.

#### Setup UptimeRobot (Takes 2 minutes):

1. **Go to** 👉 [https://uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. **Create a free account** (no credit card needed)
3. **Click "Add New Monitor"**
4. **Fill in:**
   - **Monitor Type:** HTTP(s)
   - **Friendly Name:** Lex Luthor Bot
   - **URL:** `https://your-app-name.onrender.com/ping`
     - Replace `your-app-name` with your actual Render app name
     - Example: `https://lexluthor-abc123.onrender.com/ping`
   - **Monitoring Interval:** 5 minutes
5. **Click "Create Monitor"**

**Done!** Your bot will now stay alive 24/7. UptimeRobot will ping it every 5 minutes, preventing Render from putting it to sleep. 🔥

## 🔒 SECURITY NOTES

- Never share your `SESSION_ID`
- Don't commit `settings.js` with your real credentials to GitHub
- Never push your `COOKIE_CONTENT` — add it as an environment variable on Render
- The bot stores session data in `bot_session/` — this is gitignored
- Your phone can be off — bot runs independently

---

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Bot not connecting?
- Make sure your `SESSION_ID` is valid
- Get a fresh session from the session manager if needed

### `.ig` not working?
- Set `COOKIE_CONTENT` in your environment variables
- Navigate to instagram.com, login, use the **cookies.txt LOCALLY** browser extension, export and paste the content

### Welcome/Goodbye not working?
- Make sure `WELCOME` and `GOODBYE` are `true` in settings.js
- Bot doesn't need admin for welcome/goodbye

### Bot keeps going offline on Render?
- **Did you set up UptimeRobot?** This is MANDATORY for Render free tier
- Make sure the ping URL is correct: `https://your-app.onrender.com/ping`

### Commands not responding?
- Check your `PREFIX` in settings.js (default is `.`)
- If `OWNER_ONLY` is `true`, only the owner number can run commands

### YouTube downloads failing?
- The PO Token server (`bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider`) must be running
- Check container logs for `PO Token server started on port 4416`

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

- **Bot works even when your phone is off** — session is stored on the server
- **Set `AUTO_PRESENCE` to `'recording'`** for a cooler status effect
- **Use PM2 on VPS** for automatic restarts if bot crashes
- **UptimeRobot is mandatory** for Render free tier
- **Set `OWNER_ONLY` to `true`** to keep the bot private
